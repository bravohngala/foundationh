    Huduma fOOD’s mission is to be a catalyst for positive transformation of the condition and aspirations of marginalized youth residing in but not limited to urban slums, rural areas and refugee camps. That mission originates in the founder, Henry Ohanga’s firm conviction—based on personal experience—that a wealth of untapped potential resides in these often wretched spaces, where poverty, disease, unemployment and other forms of social neglect and depravity form the backdrop of daily existence.

    The organization draws it experience of work from the founder  of the organization, Mr. George Ochieng, who was born and brought up in the informal settlement of Korogocho where the organization operates now and at some point, he happened to live in the streets of Korogocho as a street boy due to some domestic problems that happened at home that forced for a divorce of his parents.

    The organization has extensive experience in social work and working with and on the protection of slum children and youth on matters related to substance use prevention and we are dedicated to helping children and youth who happened to have been in the same experience the founder of the organization was in at some point, this is done through schools and out of school’s interventions

    Furthermore, we represent the voices of the young people and the most vulnerable from the global south on global drug policy debate, we have championed for this through various forums and conferences where we have been able to share some our best models that are evidence based.

    Furthermore, we happen to be the selected organization through our organization Executive Director to be one of the speakers at the Civil Society hearing in the preparation for the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on world drug problem in 2016 (UNGASS2016)n here.
